The advantage is that additionally to a single html render file we can also define output files.

```{r}

debug_file = paste0('debug/', params$rule, '_rmd_.Rdata')
save.image(debug_file)

df = feather::read_feather(params$input[[1]])

easyalluvial::alluvial_wide(df, fill_by = 'first_variable')

ggplot2::ggsave( params$output[[1]] )
```
